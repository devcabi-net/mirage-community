## CI/CD Pipeline Design with GitHub Actions {#cicd-pipeline-design}

### Current State and Evolution

GitHub Actions has emerged as the dominant CI/CD platform, with organizations increasingly adopting GitOps workflows for automated testing, building, and deployment. The platform's evolution in 2025 includes enhanced security features, improved performance, and better integration with cloud-native tools.

### Core Best Practices for 2025

#### 1. **Multi-Stage Pipeline Architecture**

Modern GitHub Actions workflows follow a structured approach:

```yaml
# Example enterprise-grade workflow structure
name: Production Deployment Pipeline

on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  security-scan:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Security Scan
        uses: securecodewarrior/github-action-add-sarif@v1
  
  test:
    needs: security-scan
    strategy:
      matrix:
        os: [ubuntu-latest, windows-latest, macos-latest]
        node: [18, 20, 22]
    runs-on: ${{ matrix.os }}
    
  build:
    needs: test
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    
  deploy:
    needs: build
    environment: production
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
```

#### 2. **Advanced Security Integration**

- **Secret Management**: Utilize GitHub Secrets with environment-specific access controls
- **OIDC Authentication**: Implement OpenID Connect for secure cloud deployments without long-lived credentials
- **Supply Chain Security**: Integrate dependency scanning and SBOM generation
- **Code Quality Gates**: Enforce quality standards with SonarCloud and CodeQL analysis

#### 3. **Deployment Strategies**

**Blue-Green Deployments**:
- Maintain two identical production environments
- Route traffic seamlessly between environments
- Enable instant rollbacks with zero downtime

**Canary Deployments**:
- Gradually roll out changes to a subset of users
- Monitor key metrics during deployment
- Automatic rollback on anomaly detection

**GitOps Workflow Integration**:
- Separate application code from deployment configurations
- Use ArgoCD or Flux for Kubernetes deployments
- Implement declarative infrastructure management

### Automation and Optimization

#### Reusable Workflows
Create organization-wide workflow templates to ensure consistency:

```yaml
name: Reusable Deployment
on:
  workflow_call:
    inputs:
      environment:
        required: true
        type: string
    secrets:
      deployment-token:
        required: true

jobs:
  deploy:
    environment: ${{ inputs.environment }}
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Deploy to ${{ inputs.environment }}
        run: echo "Deploying to ${{ inputs.environment }}"
```

#### Performance Optimization
- **Caching Strategies**: Implement dependency caching to reduce build times by 30-50%
- **Parallel Execution**: Leverage matrix builds for cross-platform testing
- **Resource Optimization**: Use self-hosted runners for cost optimization and performance

## Docker & Container Orchestration Strategies {#container-orchestration}

### Production-Ready Containerization

#### Multi-Stage Build Optimization

```dockerfile
# Example optimized Dockerfile for 2025
FROM node:20-alpine AS dependencies
WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm ci --only=production && npm cache clean --force

FROM node:20-alpine AS build
WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm ci
COPY . .
RUN npm run build

FROM node:20-alpine AS runtime
WORKDIR /app
RUN addgroup -g 1001 -S nodejs && adduser -S nextjs -u 1001
COPY --from=dependencies /app/node_modules ./node_modules
COPY --from=build --chown=nextjs:nodejs /app/dist ./dist
USER nextjs
EXPOSE 3000
CMD ["node", "dist/server.js"]
```

#### Security Hardening

- **Distroless Images**: Use minimal base images to reduce attack surface
- **Non-Root Users**: Always run containers as non-privileged users
- **Image Scanning**: Integrate Trivy or Snyk for vulnerability scanning
- **Supply Chain Security**: Sign images with Cosign and verify signatures

### Kubernetes Orchestration Strategies

#### Advanced Deployment Patterns

**StatefulSets for Stateful Applications**:
```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: StatefulSet
metadata:
  name: database
spec:
  serviceName: "database"
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: database
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: database
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: postgres
        image: postgres:15-alpine
        env:
        - name: POSTGRES_DB
          value: "productiondb"
        volumeMounts:
        - name: postgres-storage
          mountPath: /var/lib/postgresql/data
  volumeClaimTemplates:
  - metadata:
      name: postgres-storage
    spec:
      accessModes: ["ReadWriteOnce"]
      storageClassName: "fast-ssd"
      resources:
        requests:
          storage: 100Gi
```

#### Service Mesh Integration

Modern container orchestration leverages service mesh technologies:

- **Istio**: Advanced traffic management and security policies
- **Linkerd**: Lightweight service mesh for observability
- **Consul Connect**: Service discovery and secure communication

#### Platform Engineering Approach

Organizations are adopting platform engineering principles:

- **Internal Developer Platforms (IDPs)**: Self-service deployment platforms
- **Golden Path Templates**: Standardized deployment patterns
- **Developer Experience Optimization**: Simplified deployment workflows

function sendToAnalytics({ name, value, id }) {
  fetch('/analytics', {
    method: 'POST',
    body: JSON.stringify({ name, value, id }),
    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' }
  });
}

// Measure Core Web Vitals
getCLS(sendToAnalytics);
getFID(sendToAnalytics);
getFCP(sendToAnalytics);
getLCP(sendToAnalytics);
getTTFB(sendToAnalytics);
```

### Advanced Analytics Implementation

## Backup & Recovery Plans {#backup-recovery}

### Modern Backup Strategies

#### The 3-2-1-1-0 Backup Rule

An evolution of the traditional 3-2-1 rule for 2025:

- **3** copies of data (1 primary + 2 backups)
- **2** different storage media types
- **1** offsite/cloud copy
- **1** offline/air-gapped copy (ransomware protection)
- **0** backup errors (verified integrity)

#### Cloud-Native Backup Solutions

**Database Backup Strategies**:

```yaml
# Example automated PostgreSQL backup
apiVersion: batch/v1
kind: CronJob
metadata:
  name: postgres-backup
spec:
  schedule: "0 2 * * *"  # Daily at 2 AM
  jobTemplate:
    spec:
      template:
        spec:
          containers:
          - name: postgres-backup
            image: postgres:15-alpine
            command:
            - /bin/bash
            - -c
            - |
              pg_dump -h $POSTGRES_HOST -U $POSTGRES_USER $POSTGRES_DB | \
              gzip > /backup/backup-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S).sql.gz
              aws s3 cp /backup/ s3://backups/ --recursive
            env:
            - name: POSTGRES_HOST
              value: "database-service"
            volumeMounts:
            - name: backup-storage
              mountPath: /backup
          restartPolicy: OnFailure
```

#### Disaster Recovery Protocols

**Recovery Time Objective (RTO) and Recovery Point Objective (RPO)**:

| Service Tier | RTO Target | RPO Target | Strategy |
|-------------|------------|------------|----------|
| Critical | < 1 hour | < 15 minutes | Hot standby + real-time replication |
| Important | < 4 hours | < 1 hour | Warm standby + hourly backups |
| Standard | < 24 hours | < 24 hours | Cold backup restoration |

#### Infrastructure as Code Backup

```yaml
# Terraform state backup strategy
terraform {
  backend "s3" {
    bucket         = "terraform-state-backup"
    key            = "prod/terraform.tfstate"
    region         = "us-west-2"
    encrypt        = true
    versioning     = true
    lifecycle_rule = {
      enabled = true
      noncurrent_version_expiration {
        days = 90
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Automated Testing and Validation

#### Backup Integrity Verification

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Automated backup validation script
BACKUP_FILE="/backups/latest.sql.gz"
TEST_DB="backup_validation_test"

# Restore to test database
gunzip -c $BACKUP_FILE | psql -h localhost -U postgres -d $TEST_DB

# Run validation queries
psql -h localhost -U postgres -d $TEST_DB -c "
  SELECT 
    COUNT(*) as table_count,
    SUM(pg_total_relation_size(oid)) as total_size
  FROM pg_class 
  WHERE relkind = 'r';
"

# Cleanup test database
dropdb -h localhost -U postgres $TEST_DB
```

        resolve(entries.map(entry => ({
          name: entry.name,
          value: entry.value || entry.duration
        })));
      }).observe({ entryTypes: ['paint', 'largest-contentful-paint'] });
    });
  });
  
  console.log('Performance metrics:', metrics);
  await browser.close();
